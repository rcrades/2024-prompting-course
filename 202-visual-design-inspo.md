# Visual Design Inspiration Guide

This guide shows how to use AI tools to enhance your web app's visual design quickly and easily.

## Using AI for Visual Design Updates

1. Gather your materials:
   - Your app's HTML and CSS files
   - A screenshot of a site/app whose design you like
   - (Optional) An image representing your desired color scheme

2. Upload these to a multimodal AI tool like Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4.

3. Use a simple prompt:
   "Update my app's code to make it look like this site [or] to give it this preferred color scheme."

4. Review the AI's suggestions and implement the changes you like.
