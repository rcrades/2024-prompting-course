# Helpful Prompts Guide

This guide provides a set of prompts and guidelines for effective AI-assisted learning in web development. Always include the context that you are a beginner learning prompting and web development.

## General Prompting Template

When asking for code or explanations, use this template:



> I am trying to learn prompting and web development, but I am a beginner. Can you help me with [specific task or concept]? If you are ever providing code, please provide code I can copy and paste, with comments, and break it into sections formatted as "languagename-section-sectionnumber-sectiontheme". Also, tell me which file this goes in and which section it belongs to.

---

## File and Section Formatting

When requesting a full code file, ask the AI to include comments marking:
- Beginning of the file and its purpose
- Beginning of each section
- End of each section
- End of the file

Example prompt:
```

Please include comments marking the beginning and end of the file, as well as the beginning and end of each section. Use the format "languagename-section-sectionnumber-sectiontheme" for each section.
```
